    excerpt:Give Birth on Your Own Turf,
    content: <p>"Follow one woman’s journey through childbirth in a hospital setting, and how that experience begat her decision to deliver three more children at home".
              Deciding where your baby will be born can have a lasting impact that reaches far beyond the experience of a single day. For Ginny Yurich’s family, a home birth changed the trajectory of their lives. Recently, they moved to a 14-acre farm, where they tend ducks and chickens, and have plans to add more livestock and a garden. Ginny also maintains a blog, where she encourages parents to provide the ample outdoor time necessary for kids’ optimal emotional and physical health. These new ventures directly resulted from her decision to give birth to her third child in the peace and comfort of her own home.</p>

              Ginny is part of a small but growing trend toward home birth. The numbers of planned out-of-hospital births dwindled to almost nothing in the middle of the 20th century, and then rose slightly in the 1970s during the natural childbirth movement. The rate of home births has risen again in the 21st century, to 1.5 percent nationwide.
              choose to birth on their own turf for a variety of reasons. Among the benefits: the security and comfort of familiar surroundings; a relaxed atmosphere; freedom from unnecessary medical interventions; independence to move about and make decisions regarding care; a chosen crew of family and helpers; and a post-birth bonding time with no separation from the baby, facilitating a smooth start to breastfeeding.</p>
              Ginny had also wanted natural births for her first two babies. During her first pregnancy, Ginny happened to meet a doula, a professional labor assistant devoted to providing physical and emotional support to mothers during labor and birth. Ginny learned from the doula that, while a healthy baby is the most important goal in any birth, it also matters how mothers experience the process. Ginny hoped to give birth in a tub of warm water with no interventions, but she developed preeclampsia, which disqualified her from childbirth at the birth center she’d chosen. Instead, she went to a hospital, where intravenous drugs induced her labor. After 24 hours, Ginny was diagnosed with “failure to progress” and wheeled to the operating room.</p>

            The hospital allowed her to attempt a vaginal birth with her second child, but, once again, Ginny’s labor didn’t progress quickly enough, and she underwent a second cesarean section. Ginny and her husband now had two healthy children, but she sums up their births this way: “I don’t remember much. I was alone a lot, and there was a randomness about it. The staff involved were people I didn’t know and would never see again."

    excerpt:  Use Goldenrod to Relieve Allergy Symptoms,
    content: <p> Medicinal but misunderstood, goldenrod can be used as an herbal remedy to combat the symptoms of allergies.
              After a particularly long sneezing fit and several bless you's, my coworker cursed seasonal allergies and the plants that caused them. As someone who has never experienced allergies, and really only understands the baseline of “some plants release pollen that hurts people”, I was curious about how allergies work, and if some plants are the culprit, could others be the solution?</p>

              <p>In short, pollen allergies are caused by misidentification, wherein some people's immune systems consider pollen a dangerous foreign substance (it is harmless) and attempt to rid it from the body through sneezing, runny nose, congestion, etc (4). This prompts the body’s inflammatory response to kick in, making the throat tighter and thus more difficult to pass air and food. Unfortunately, it has been found that “More than 50 million Americans have experienced various types of allergies each year” and also that “Allergies are the 6th leading cause of chronic illness in the U.S.” (5) In order to relieve these symptoms, people often take antihistamines to help control the body's inflammatory response. As with any over-the-counter or prescription drugs, there are quite a few harmful side effects. As always, talk with your primary care provider and make sure that you know what you’re taking and how the risks/benefits equate.</p>
               Goldenrod Medicinal but Misunderstood</p>

              <p>After asking about treatment methods and medications she took to relieve some of the discomforts, my coworker mentioned how she would go home and have her goldenrod tea. While it wouldn’t cure her allergies, it would definitely help to reduce the symptoms.</p>
             
              <p>This begged the question, If goldenrod is useful in reducing allergies symptoms, why doesn't everyone use it? 
              What I soon found was that goldenrod is often mistaken for ragweed, and unfortunately assumed to be the cause of many allergens. “The most common culprit for fall allergies is ragweed, a plant that grows wild almost everywhere, but especially on the East Coast and in the Midwest. Ragweed blooms and releases pollen from August to November. In many areas of the country, ragweed pollen levels are highest in early to mid-September.” (3) The truth, however, is that while Goldenrod is in the same family as ragweed (shared by over 23,000 different plants), it differs in genus and tribe (7). Specifically to allergies, they differ in pollen type, with goldenrod having “large, heavy pollen that is less likely to be allergenic.”<br></p>

              Using Goldenrod for Allergy Relief</p>
             
              <p>Though our farm is constantly surrounded by it, this is the first year I’ve actively noticed and harvested goldenrod. It is a beautiful yellow flowering plant that dries quickly and easily for tea.   We’ve recently added it to our House Tea blend as it supports the bronchial passages, which we’ve found are more susceptible to sickness caused by seasonal changes in the air.</p>
             
              <p>Furthermore, goldenrod can be used in conjunction with other anti-inflammatory plants (elderflower and nettles)(1) to make an effective allergy-relief tea! Simply gather the required ingredients (or purchase the herbs already dried & mix!), dry them on a screen, making sure to turn them once a day to prevent mold, and finely crush them together when fully dry. Try adding stevia leaf or peppermint to the mixture to make it more to your liking! 
              Outside the realm of allergies, goldenrod is a supporter of the urinary tract, helping to dissolve kidney stones (2). It also acts as a natural plant dye, turning natural wool a vibrant yellow (8).</p>

              <p>Less medicinally, and more aesthetically, I’ve taken to hanging golden throughout our house, over doors, and tucked into woven baskets in every corner. Seeing the bright yellow flowers contrast the dark green leaves makes even the dullest spaces look alive and happy!</p>
             
              <p>This is the power of goldenrod, and I suppose of most healing herbs, while they work to physically nurture the body, the process of collecting, transforming, and using them nurtures the soul.</p>

    excerpt : Food Medicine: 5 Autumn Healers,
    content:  <p>Mother Earth gifts us every autumn with produce to heal seasonal illnesses and balance us with our natural environments.
              Now that we are post-autumnal equinox, mid-October, between a Harvest and Blue Moon, it is easy to notice the way the Earth is changing. The temperature has dropped, the leaves are dressing the trees in oranges and reds, the sky is becoming more overcast. A change of seasons makes it easier for us to have more heightened awareness than usual, and after the busyness of summer  —even a slower than usual pandemic summer — autumn offers us the chance to reflect on the year and prepare for the long cold months ahead.</p>

              <p>Winter often brings illness and negatively-associated emotions. Thankfully, Mother Earth gifts us every autumn with produce to heal seasonal illnesses and balance us with our natural environments. We’re all aware that apples and pumpkins are in season now, as well as a variety of root vegetables. The Earth gives us exactly what we need; each of these foods holds medicinal and spiritual properties that align with the cooler seasons and bring us into balance.</p>
              
              <h2>Here are a few offerings from the earth that can heal and balance us this autumn
              Apples</h2>
              
              <p>Going apple picking at an orchard is a popular autumn activity, and while baking pies is a great way to enjoy this fall fruit, there are many reasons to make them a regular part of your diet. Apples are loaded with fiber and antioxidants and are a great source of vitamin C, which boosts immunity and keeps skin healthy. Apples also contribute to bone health and are anti-inflammatory. But this popular autumn fruit does more than just help your body fight off colds; as a symbol of love, health, wisdom, and abundance, you can use apples in your autumn and moon rituals to remind you of these qualities. And since apples have a red skin, you can use them to help balance your root chakra, helping you stay grounded through the long winter.</p>
              Beets

              <p>People either love beets or have never had them cooked right, and there are plenty of reasons to cook them until you love them. Beets have a variety of nutrients, such as fiber, iron, manganese, and vitamins B2, A, K, and C. They regulate blood flow, which is important when it starts to get cold and we lean toward a more sedentary lifestyle. Beets keep the heart and liver healthy, and they also aid digestion. The strong earthy taste of beets is a reminder that this root vegetable offers grounding qualities, and understandably, are another great food for balancing your root chakra. These deep red veggies also have a long history of being associated with passion, love, and beauty, so when the autumn and winter months begin to feel dreary, cook up a batch of beets to heighten your awareness of these necessary characteristics.</p>
